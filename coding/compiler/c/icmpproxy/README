icmpproxy - A simple app for tunneling traffic over ICMP (linux)

icmpproxy was written to be light (no kernel patches) and non-stupid (ie 
allow ssh and things rather than just send shell commands).

When icmpproxy sets up an interface it0. All traffic to this interface will be
tunneled through ICMP ECHO_REPLY packets, to the other side, where they will
be snatched up and passed through the it0 interface on the remote machine. The
client will also send ICMP ECHO packets to the server 

Usage for servers:
    icmpproxy id networkmask/24
    icmpproxy RF 172.16.0.0

Usage for clients:
    icmpproxy id serverip
    icmpproxy RF 66.35.250.150

Now set up the interface and routes, and a nice, low mtu:
    ifconfig it0 up 172.16.0.x
    route add -net 172.16.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 it0
    ifconfig it0 mtu 1000

At this point, you should be able to ssh between the boxen. Set up connection
sharing if you want to, but keep in mind that there's no form of
authentication.
